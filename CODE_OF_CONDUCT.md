# SaIT Tech Events – Code of Conduct

Welcome to **SaIT Tech Events** 
This project is built by students for students — a space to collaborate, learn, and build something meaningful together.  

Our goal is to maintain an environment where contributors feel comfortable pushing code, experimenting with ideas, and helping each other grow.

## General Guidelines

- **Be respectful** toward other contributors. Everyone starts somewhere — guide, don’t gatekeep.  
- **Keep your commits meaningful.** Even a small PR that fixes a typo or cleans up code contributes to progress.  
- **Write clear commit messages.** Explain *why* a change was made, not just *what* changed.  
- **Document your work.** Whether it’s a README update or inline comments, clarity helps others learn and build on your ideas.  
- **Stay consistent.** Follow existing conventions (naming, structure, formatting) to keep the repo clean and readable.  
- **Use discussions and issues wisely.** Share ideas, ask questions, and suggest improvements openly.

---

## What We Appreciate

- Pull Requests that solve a problem, improve UI/UX, or enhance developer experience.  
- Contributions that make the platform more **centralized and student-centric**, improving the overall experience for users.
- Contributions that reduce complexity, fix warnings, or improve performance.

---

## What to Avoid

- Submitting code without testing or reviewing.  
- Large, unexplained changes that break others’ workflow.  
- Arguments over code style — prefer thoughtful discussion instead.  

---

## Communication & Collaboration

We use GitHub issues and pull requests for all discussions and reviews.  
Be open to feedback and help others improve their contributions as well.

If a PR or suggestion isn’t accepted, don’t be discouraged — use it as a stepping stone to refine your understanding.

## The Spirit of This Project

This is a **learning-ground open-source project**. The goal isn’t perfection — it’s **growth, collaboration, and contribution**.  
Every small PR counts, and every contributor makes SaIT Tech Events better.

Let’s build this together.
