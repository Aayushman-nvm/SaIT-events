## Making Changes

- **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix:
  
    ```bash
    git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
    ```

- **Commit your work** with a clear message:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "<your-commit-message>"
    ```

- **Push your branch** to the remote repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin <your-branch-name>
    ```


### Explanation

- `<your-branch-name>` → Replace with `main` or any custom branch you created for your feature or fix.  
- `<your-commit-message>` → Replace with a clear, descriptive commit message.  
- `git add .` is included before committing to stage all your changes, which is standard practice.

---

## Code Style

- Follow **TypeScript** best practices.
- Use **ESLint** and **Prettier** for clean code.
- Components should be kept modular and reusable.

---

## Issues

- Before opening a new issue, check if it already exists.
- When opening an issue, provide as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, screenshots, browser, etc.).
